    "## Train Test Split\n",
    "The shuffle=True/False argument drastically changes the linear model fit. If shuffle=False, the data are split sequentially into train, validate, and test sets (80:10:10). The entire data set covers a little over 5 years, shuffle=False means the last year is not used in training the data. Omitting the last year of data from the training dataset crushes the validation model accuracy (r-squared, mean squared error) and is not surprising given the dramatic disruption of air traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively recent recovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using shuffle=True leads to robust r-squared and MSE metrics that will likely be mostly retained in the test set. However, the accuracy of the model on future data will likely be lower as air-traffic is likely to continue changing for unpredictable reasons. Any forecasting model will likely require frequent training updates with current data to stay relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"shuffle=False\" is used for this analysis. This will have implications for prediction algorithms and reduce the effectivenes of algorithms like recurrent neural networks that are designed to digest sequences of data, \"windows\", such as 7 days of sequential data."
