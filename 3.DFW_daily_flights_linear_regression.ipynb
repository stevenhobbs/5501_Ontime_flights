    "## Train Test Split\n",
    "The shuffle=True/False argument drastically changes the linear model fit. If shuffle=False, the data are split sequentially into train, validate, and test sets (80:10:10). The entire data set covers a little over 5 years, shuffle=False means the last year is not used in training the data. Omitting the last year of data from the training dataset crushes the validation model accuracy (r-squared, mean squared error) and is not surprising given the dramatic disruption of air traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively recent recovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using shuffle=True leads to robust r-squared and MSE metrics that will likely be mostly retained in the test set. However, the accuracy of the model on future data will likely be lower as air-traffic is likely to continue changing for unpredictable reasons. Any forecasting model will likely require frequent training updates with current data to stay relevant.\n",
